These are selected, anonymous student feedback comments I've received about my teaching:

> "*He was always willing to help out when I needed. He provided just the right amount of guidence, in that it was the perfect balance of developing my skills individually while also being nudged in the right direction when I asked a question. Ben was very exceptional, one of the best TAs I've ever had. He was also available to meet outside of lab hours so that I could ask him a question, and he gave me some great feedback to improve my writing skills in a research context as well.*" - PHYS 295 student, Fall 2017, U. of Alberta.
