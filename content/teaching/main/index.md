### Statement of Teaching Philosophy
{{< admonition type=quote title="This is a tip" open=false >}}
###### Introduction: The Necessity of Belief
{{< figure src="possible.jpg" width="400">}}
In conversation, when people learn I’m a physicist they often reply along the lines of, “Oh, I’m not smart enough to do that.” This reply reveals the common belief in the “fixed mindset”: that someone’s success and ability to learn is a product of their innate talents, and that these aptitudes cannot be changed[^Dweck]. In contrast, I learned from my mother at a young age the simple phrase, “If you believe you can, or if you believe you can’t, you’re right”[^Ford]. In my learning practice, I’ve chosen to believe that I can learn anything I desire. I don’t see myself as having inherently superior cognitive abilities compared to anyone else; rather I see my success as a direct product of personal effort and a “growth mindset.” Because of the growth I have seen in myself, I am convinced that every student has the potential to learn any subject they desire and work at. This strong belief in students’ potential is foundational to my motivation and to my methods for teaching and learning.

###### To Learn is to Change

{{< figure src="chrysalis.jpg" width="400">}}

Learning, in the physical sciences, is not just about students gaining knowledge, but rather their developing a relationship with truth. Gaining knowledge of a subject is a necessary, but insufficient, part of that process. When a teacher is involved with a student in the craft of learning, each plays an important role. The relationship must be facilitated by a teacher who has a preexisting relationship with the truth of the subject matter. In this sense, they act as an ambassador to the minds and hearts of the students. This relationship must also be received and accepted on the part of the student. I am not describing a passive exercise whereby data and facts are transmitted and absorbed via osmosis. Rather it is a highly active process in which both the student and the teacher come to understand themselves, each other, and the truth of the subject matter.

To receive knowledge, a student must first possess a sufficient desire to seek it and ask the necessary questions. It then involves the personal effort of expanding, rearranging, and potentially discarding one’s knowledge structure to incorporate and integrate new knowledge and understanding. This is a demanding and mentally rigorous process. It requires self-awareness of one’s knowledge structure, and also the imagination to reinvent it [^Odden][^Covey]. Truly, learning is a process of personal change. Furthermore, physics problem-solving skills must be practiced and honed. As a teaching assistant, I instilled a growth mindset in students by explaining that learning physics is not unlike learning to be a proficient pianist[^Shifman]. This philosophy of receiving knowledge loosely resembles the constructivist theory of learning; however, I reject conventional relativism when applied to learning physical science.

In favoring an objective physical reality, I also try to illuminate any inconsistencies and misconceptions the students may have. There are many ways I accomplish this, but one effective way is using real data. For example, one high school physics student I tutored could not see that his intuition contradicted Newton’s laws of motion. We tossed his smartphone around in the air, and the onboard accelerometer provided him the necessary insight to successfully reconfigure his knowledge structure. Smartphone sensors and applications[^Staacks] are some of many excellent tools for connecting students with real physical data.

Students and teachers approach a subject with their own experiences and understanding and this prior knowledge may form a structure. As a teacher, I have the responsibility to learn and understand the knowledge structure of my individual students. This may be through concept inventories[^Hestenes] or via informal discussion. I then craft learning activities to scaffold their structure throughout its renovation. 


###### Enthusiasm and Questions

{{< figure src="question.jpg" width="400">}}


Occasionally the people I talk with tell me about their experiences in high school or university physics courses. Most of the time, these were either extremely positive or extremely negative. As I dig deeper, I almost universally find that what people remember the most about their physics teachers is their presence or lack of enthusiasm. While working as an adjunct professor, I tried to convey my passion for physics by introducing students to real-world questions. Physics is not something that humanity has solved and carefully tucked away into textbooks. There are still real unanswered questions[^List] – ones that can capture the imagination of young students. I’ve shown students My Question – the one that carried me into physics and one that still goes unanswered: “Why can sound waves cause a bubble to [release a flash of light?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhiaFa9kaH4)” Whether or not my students find their own physics question is outside of my control. My simple hope is that my students will remember my enthusiasm for physics many years later.

###### Trust and Success

{{< figure src="trust.jpg" width="400">}}


For the process of learning to be successful, it must be founded upon a relationship of trust between students and teachers[^Bain]. Where practical, I learn my students’ names as quickly as possible. I also employ formative and summative assessments with grading practices that are encouraging and redemptive, not punitive. Trust is fostered as I treat students as individuals - with respect, concern, and interest; I recognize that, like them, I am also learning and growing. At the time of my retirement, I will primarily know that I have been successful as a teacher if my students knew that I cared about them, believed in them, and wanted them to grow and succeed, not just in physics but in all areas of their lives.

### Teaching Experience
{{< figure src="desks.jpg" width="400">}}

#### Adjunct Principle Instructor
Between January to July 2016, I worked as an adjunct principle-instructor at [Brigham Young University-Idaho](https://www.byui.edu/) in Rexburg, Idaho, USA. I was responsible for designing and implementing the course layouts, instruction, and assessments for several classes of 20-30 students each:

{{< details summary="**Course Descriptions:**">}}
* **PHYS 121, Principles of Physics 1**: The first course in the calculus-based sequence of introductory physics for science majors. The course focused on Newtonian laws of motion and the concept of energy. In this course, I applied principles of peer-instruction active learning. [*Spring 2016*].

* **PHYS 220, Principles of Physics 3**: The third calculus-based introductory physics course teaching principles of electricity and magnetism and how they relate to Maxwell’s equations. [*Winter 2016*].

* **PHYS 150, Beginning Physics Lab**: This hands-on laboratory course introduced first-year students to the basics of experimental physics, with emphasis in experimental uncertainty, statistical analysis, regressions, and simple numerical modelling. [*Winter & Spring 2016*]

### Student Feedback
These are selected, anonymous student feedback comments I've received about my teaching:
{{< admonition type=quote title="PHYS 295 student, Fall 2017, U. of Alberta" open=true >}}
"*He was always willing to help out when I needed. He provided just the right amount of guidence, in that it was the perfect balance of developing my skills individually while also being nudged in the right direction when I asked a question. Ben was very exceptional, one of the best TAs I've ever had. He was also available to meet outside of lab hours so that I could ask him a question, and he gave me some great feedback to improve my writing skills in a research context as well.*"
