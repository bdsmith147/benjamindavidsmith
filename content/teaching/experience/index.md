I have been involved in various teaching roles since early in my academic career.

### Adjunct Principle Instructor
Between January to July 2016, I worked as an adjunct principle-instructor at [Brigham Young University-Idaho](https://www.byui.edu/) in Rexburg, Idaho, USA. I was responsible for designing and implementing the course layouts, instruction, and assessments for several classes of 20-30 students each:

* **PHYS 121, Principles of Physics 1**: The first course in the calculus-based sequence of introductory physics for science majors. The course focused on Newtonian laws of motion and the concept of energy. In this course, I applied principles of peer-instruction active learning. [*Spring 2016*].

* **PHYS 220, Principles of Physics 3**: The third calculus-based introductory physics course teaching principles of electricity and magnetism and how they relate to Maxwell’s equations. [*Winter 2016*].

* **PHYS 150, Beginning Physics Lab**: This hands-on laboratory course introduced first-year students to the basics of experimental physics, with emphasis in experimental uncertainty, statistical analysis, regressions, and simple numerical modelling. [*Winter & Spring 2016*]

### Teaching Assistant
* **PHSCS 105, General Physics 1**: Applied, non-calculus physics course covering mechanics, heat, wave motion, and sound. (Tutorial Lab TA) [*Fall 2010 – Winter 2011*].

* **PHSCS 123, Introduction to Waves, Optics and Thermodynamics**: Calculus-based course on waves, thermal physics, optics, special relativity, and introduction to modern physics. (Tutorial Lab TA), [*Fall 2013*].

* **PHSCS 108, General Physics Lab 2**: Lab experiments in electricity, magnetism, optics, and modern physics; measuring and analyzing data. (Lab instructor TA), [*Winter –Summer 2014*].

* **PHSCS 245, Experiments in Contemporary Physics**: In-depth, multi-period experiments in contemporary physics, experimental methods using advanced instrumentation. (Lab instructor TA), [*Fall 2014 – Winter 2015*].

* **PHYS 130**: (Whetlock)[*Fall 2016*]
* **PHYS 295**: (Freeman)[*Fall 2017*]
* **PHYS 292**: (LeBlanc)[*Fall 2018*]
