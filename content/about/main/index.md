The following sections describe three interrelated and indivisible aspects of my life. Each component informs and enriches the others.

## Physics
I first learned to appreciate science from my parents. My mother taught me to ask questions and to keep trying. My father likewise encouraged me and gave me a sense of wonder for the universe; we've spent many fond times looking at the stars together.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Alberta. I am proud to work and study under the supervision of [Professor Lindsay J. LeBlanc](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/ultracold) at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

## Family

I love my family. I am married to an incredible woman, and together we have three wonderful children. They give my life immense meaning and purpose. I also love my ancestors: those in my family on whose shoulders I stand. I love to learn about them. 

I cannot look back on my ancestors without feeling gratitude for their lives, stories, and legacies. 

I also feel grateful for the places they lived, for the people who have called those lands home for so long, and for the opportunities I have been given to live, work, and continue on where I am.

## Faith
Finally, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. I find hope, encouragement, and healing in His restored Gospel. My faith in God the Father and Jesus Christ is founded on what I've been taught and on what I have learned and know of myself. My living faith distills from the choice I make to "let God prevail" in my life [^1]. As a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist), I strive to love and serve all others as my neighbors ([Luke 10:25-37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/10?lang=eng&id=25-37#p25)). I am still a work in progress, and I am grateful for the people around me who let me try again when I fail.
