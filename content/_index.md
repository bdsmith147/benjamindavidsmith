Benjamin D. Smith graduated in 2015 with a B.Sc. in physics, *cum laude*, from Brigham Young University. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Alberta under Prof. Lindsay LeBlanc. His experimental research centers around the interactions between light and various forms of quantum matter, both ultracold Bose-Einstein condensates and room-temperature atomic vapors. In addition to research, he is passionate about teaching and illuminating the amazing world of quantum mechanics. Benjamin and his wife, Kristie, are the parents of three wonderful children.
