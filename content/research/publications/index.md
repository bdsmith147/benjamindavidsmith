This page describes some of the research publications I have been priviledged to coauthor. I want all visitors to feel comfortable on this website. To do that, I'll briefly summarize each publication in a way that's targeted to:
1. The average cool person :sunglasses:, and to
2. Experts in the field :nerd_face:.

## 1. GPUs for Physics
**Citation:**
> **Smith, Benjamin D.**, Logan W. Cooke, and Lindsay J. LeBlanc. "[GPU-accelerated solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation for simulating 2D spinor BECs.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465522000327)" Computer Physics Communications 275 (2022): 108314.
