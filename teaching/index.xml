      <description>Statement of Teaching Philosophy Introduction: The Necessity of Belief In conversation, when people learn I‚Äôm a physicist they often reply along the lines of, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not smart enough to do that.‚Äù This reply reveals the common belief in the ‚Äúfixed mindset‚Äù: that someone‚Äôs success and ability to learn is a product of their innate talents, and that these aptitudes cannot be changed1. In contrast, I learned from my mother at a young age the simple phrase, ‚ÄúIf you believe you can, or if you believe you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre right‚Äù2.</description>

      <description>GTLP As a PhD student at the University of Alberta, I participated in the Graduate Teaching and Learning Program (GTLP). This program is designed to help graduate students learn and engage with best practices and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and course design. It supports graduate students in their development as educators and future primary instructors.
üî∏ I have completed Levels 1, 2, and 3 of GTLP.
 The following are several artifacts from my participation in GTLP Level 3, produced between January to April 2022:</description>

      <description>These are selected, anonymous student feedback comments I&amp;rsquo;ve received about my teaching:
 &amp;ldquo;He was always willing to help out when I needed. He provided just the right amount of guidence, in that it was the perfect balance of developing my skills individually while also being nudged in the right direction when I asked a question. Ben was very exceptional, one of the best TAs I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. He was also available to meet outside of lab hours so that I could ask him a question, and he gave me some great feedback to improve my writing skills in a research context as well.</description>
