      <description>As a PhD student at the University of Alberta, I participated in the Graduate Teaching and Learning Program (GTLP). This program is designed to help graduate students learn and engage with best practices and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and course design. It supports graduate students in their development as educators and future primary instructors.
üî∏ I have completed Levels 1, 2, and 3 of GTLP.
The following are several artifacts from my participation in GTLP Level 3, produced between January to April 2022:</description>
